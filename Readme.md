## Introduction
In 2018, reddit user u/Metabot submitted a delightful homebrew Background to
r/UnearthedArcana: "Was a Goat for 10 Years." With their permission, I've ported
the background to Baldur's Gate 3.

The full effect of the mod isn't quite possible yet. The original Homebrew
advises having horns and rectangular irises, both of which seem likely
candidates for separate mods later on down the line.

## A WHAT for how long?
A Goat. For 10 Years. Having been a Goat for so long, you know your way around
animals, and have become quite athletic, granting you proficiency in Animal
Handling and Athletics. You also gain Surefooted, granting you immunity to muddy
and difficult terrain. Your irises are rectangular, granting you a small amount
of Darkvision, and you've taken a liking to bushy beards.


## Installation
This mod works with [Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), and possibly Vortex and Manual
Installations. BG3 Mod Managers is by far the simplest method, and as such is recommended one.
